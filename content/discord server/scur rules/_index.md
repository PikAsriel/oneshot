# Self Contained Universes (Reprise) Rules & Requirements

This is the server's roleplay section. Before you can enter, please see the following rules.

0: **Respect people AND their characters!**
> Take both the character and the person behind it into consideration, and have common decency!

1: **No NSFW content, shitposting, or ERP here.**
> Keep it to DMs if absolutely necessary.

2: **Most OOC talk should stay in `#scu-readme`.**
> The occasional comment is fine, but not full conversations.

3: **Both parties MUST agree if a character is to be killed.**
> One cannot kill another character if the person behind the character is not okay with it. If a character is going out of their way to be antagonistic, and violating rule 0, contact a staff.

4: **Refrain from godmodding, powerplaying, or metagaming.**
> These are unfair to other people, obviously.

5: **Don't push major story decisions by yourself!**
> Communicate with those around you to help push the story forward!

6: **Don't bring out-of-roleplay beef/drama into the roleplay.**
> That'll just make everything less fun for the people involved.

**Failure to comply with these rules will result in a kick from the section, and a server warning!**
